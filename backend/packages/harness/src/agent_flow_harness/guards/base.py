"""Guard protocol and result type.

A :class:`Guard` is a coarse-grained gate spliced around the react node as
LangGraph nodes (``[guard_in] -> react -> [guard_out] -> END``). It decides
whether a step may run (``check_in``) and whether the step's output is
accepted (``check_out``), returning a :class:`GuardResult`.

Guard vs Middleware (SPEC §9): a Guard *blocks* the flow; a Middleware
*observes/rewrites* without blocking.
